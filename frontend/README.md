# Buddy | Your collage companion

Collage is one of the coolest experience we have in our lives. Meeting new people, learning different things and trying to figure out the life as we prepare to go into the real world. It is one of the most exciting times we have in our lives.

Now, what if I tell you that there is a companion out there for you, who is already familiar with the collage, who is funny, witty, dependable and helpful. Would you like to be friends with him or her? You would, wouldn't you? That's why we bring you Buddy - your collage companion. It is there for you to remember your schedule, notify you when you have your classes, connects you with your collage groups, helps you find the course material to prepare for exams, lets you know all the cool places around your collage campus and many more. It is like you have a companion all the time that takes away all the worry of managing those small but important details so you can focus on the main thing and that is - experiencing the true collage life.

# Getting Started with App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
